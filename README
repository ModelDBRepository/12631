Note: This model only runs under UNIX (and linux) for the
current version of neuron (5.2).  Future versions of neuron for the
mac and pc will be able to run this model.

* simulation from:
Lytton WW. Computer model of clonazepam's effect in thalamic slice. 
Neuroreport, 8:3339-3343, 1997. 
Figs. 3 (Fig3.gif; reticularis cells) and 4 (Fig4.gif; thalamocortical cells), p 3342

This simulation is very similar to the one published in the paper
  but is not identical due to variations among randomizers using
  supposedly identical algorithms.  The original was run under Sun
  Solaris.  The example files included here were produced under
  Intel Linux.  I have chosen traces from the current runs that are
  very similar to those in the publication.  However, these specific
  traces may not look identical if a different randomizer is used.
  I also graph all 64 traces from the network so that they can all
  be looked at and compared to the figure.

* COMPILE and RUN:
  nrnivmodl
RUN: 
  $CPU/special init.hoc -

* TO JUST LOOK AT PRE-SAVED DATA
  $CPU/special disp.hoc -

to look at your newly run data later modify disp.hoc line 23 
               FROM 
showfiles("ctl.dat","czp.dat")
                TO 
showfiles("ctlnew.dat","czpnew.dat")

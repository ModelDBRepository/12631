/*
All files, except this one, are "as is" from Bill Lytton. In particular,
when the simulation is launched by loading the init.hoc file, they
use some commands which are linux specific such as "grep -a".
To launch init.hoc or disp.hoc on other machines one may have
to change the lines in those files which read:

uname = "i586"
osname = "Linux"

The original files came in a compressed archive,
95nov29.tar.gz, which expanded into a directory named,
batch95nov29.01
